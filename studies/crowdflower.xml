<!-- Instructions -->

Each page of this study contains 10 pairs of sounds. Each pair contains 2 5-second sounds. These sounds may be purely synthetic tones, synthetic mixtures of real recordings, or portions of real outdoor recordings.

For each pair, please listen to each sound in its entirety and report which sound is more realistic. Sometimes the sounds may be the exact same, in which case you can choose "No difference." If you can't tell which sound is more realistic, select "Don't know." 

Please feel free to complete as many pages of this study as you would like. Your help is much appreciated!
